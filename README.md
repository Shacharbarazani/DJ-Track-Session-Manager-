In this project, I developed a C++ systems application that simulates the core logic of a professional DJ controller. The system manages DJ sessions and audio tracks (MP3/WAV) through a modular architecture, including components for track parsing, playlist handling, and session control. To improve efficiency, the software implements an LRU-based caching mechanism for track reuse, while emphasizing memory-safe design using RAII principles. The project focuses on clean separation of responsibilities, maintainable system structure, and efficient resource management.
